# Network_attack_detection
This project aims to analyze the traffic in your network and predict an attack that may happen .
It's an ML project i have used UNSW_NB15 as an dataset to train the model
I have  analyzed the log file, finding the correlation between attack behavioud and the features to come up with probable conclusions and results that helped in identifying malicious behavior and potential threats and attacks in the network of our dataset.
This project has top 5 features of UNSW-NB15 Dataset that is extracted from the
total 45 features by using combination association rule mining algorithm and
using Random Forest approach.
